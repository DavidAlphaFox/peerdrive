File stores (file)
==================

File stores take only the source argument: the path to the directory where the
content is stored. No other options are supported currently.

Network stores (net)
====================

Network stores mount remote stores through the network which are shared by
other PeerDrive instances. The store needs at least the source argument which
specifies the remote address and store in the following format:

  store@server[:port]

where 'store' is the label of the exported store, 'server' is the DNS of IP
address of the remote store server and 'port' is the optional port number.

For TLS the following options may also be given. Most options are directly
passed to the Erlang SSL application:

 tls=deny     |             -- No TLS (default)
     optional |             -- Use TLS if available on peer
     required               -- Always use TLS, fail if server does not support TLS

 cacertfile=cacert.pem      -- Root certificate(s)
 certfile=my-cert.pem       -- Client certificate
 keyfile=my-private-key.pem -- Client private key
 verify_peer=true           -- Verify server certificate

Encrypted stores
================

Encrypted stores are just a front-end to other stores. They don't store the data
themselves but transparently encrypt and decrypt them before passing it to the
backing store. The backing store must have been mounted with the 'noverify'
option, otherwise any writes of the encrypted store will fail.

The source argument is the backing stores SId, encoded as URN in the following
form: "urn:peerdrive:store:000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f". Additionally a
password must be specified as credential in the following format: "pwd=secret".
