== POSIX file system interface to PeerDrive ==

- FUSE, single mount point
- Root directory shows all stores
- Under each store directory only the documents on that store -> per store access
- Synchronization/replication handled by external rules
- direct access to doc/rev by special '.docs' resp. '.revs' directory

examples:
/sys/.revs/00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff/MyFileTitle
/usr/foo/bar.txt
  |   |    |
  |   |    \-- "public.text" document
  |   \------- "org.peerdrive.container" document
  \----------- store name

== Access to legacy file system from PeerDrive ==

- not provided, too many problems
	- user should see break instead of relying on not provided features

- cannot guarantee semantics
	- transactinal features (commit/close)
	- extended meta data
		- could be stored in hidden files
		- would break if file is moved/edited/replaced/... in legacy app
		- will lead to meta data loss -> real data loss in users view
	- revision history (could only keep last revision)
		- breaks sync/replication features

- howto remember doc-id's on read only file systems?
