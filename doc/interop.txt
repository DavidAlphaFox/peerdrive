== POSIX file system interface to Hotchpotch ==

FUSE, single mount point

/docs -- virtual directory for all documents (rw)
/revs -- virtual directory to access all revisions (read only)
/stores -- directory with all stores (rw)

examples:
/.revs/00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff/MyFileTitle
/usr/...

Problem cases
	- /docs/UUID doc on multiple stores
		- single revision
			- open the first rev when opened ro
			- update everywhere when opened rw
		- multiple revisions
			- priority list
			- fail
	- write on close when changed in between
		- can only happen if changed in hotchpotch _and_ FUSE simultaniously
		- application expects that all data has been written
		- cannot commit because of wrong revision
		- retry commit as merge ('FILE' part only)
