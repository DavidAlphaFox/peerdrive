PeerDrive is a open source file system to securely store, organize, share and
sync your files from everywhere. It is built on a purely distributed
peer-to-peer data model and will be a perfect solution when you need your data
on different devices in different locations without relying on a permanent
network connection or central infrastructure.

For an introduction into PeerDrive's features see
[peerdrive.org](http://www.peerdrive.org), the
[Wiki](https://github.com/peerdrive/peerdrive/wiki) on the project home and the
[doc/](https://github.com/peerdrive/peerdrive/tree/master/doc) directory.

Current status
==============

Currently PeerDrive is in the early alpha stage and hence (unless you're really
brave) not ready for production. The basic design is settled and there is a
prototype implementation of the file system in Erlang. Mounting via FUSE/Dokan,
network transparency and automatic synchronization/replication are roughly
working.  Additionally some small GUI applications exist to demonstrate the
full feature set.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6
    * PyQt >=4.6.x
    * protobuf (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
    * magic (optional)
* Erlang >= R14A (Windows: >= R14B03)
    * rebar (http://github.com/rebar/rebar)

Try it out
==========

Currently there is no installation needed. Do the following steps to try it
out. It is assumed that Erlang, Rebar and Python are all in your path.

1. Clone the git repository: `git clone git://github.com/peerdrive/peerdrive.git`
2. Open two terminals
3. Type in the 1st terminal:
    * `make`
    * `cd server`
    * `./peerdrive.sh` or on Windows: `peerdrive.bat`
    * This will start the PeerDrive server in the foreground. To gracefully
      shut down the server type `q().`.
    * The stores will be mounted to ./vfs by default (assuming fuserl resp.
      erldokan are installed)
4. In the 2nd terminal type:
    * `cd client`
    * `./peerdrive-applet.py`

Initially no stores are mounted. Use `./mount.py <dir> <name>` to mount a store
as label <name> in directory <dir>.
