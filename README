Hotchpotch is a document oriented mix of revision control, file system and
database concepts. It is intended to store, organize and retrieve your data in
novel ways.

Currently it is only a prototype to try out several ideas, refine semantics and
the API and to figure out the impact to the user interface. Check the doc
directory for some infos and ideas.

== Requirements ==

Python 2.5/2.6
	+ PyQt >=4.4.x
	+ simplejson
	+ magic (optional)
Erlang >= R12

== Try it out ==

Currently there is no installation possible. Do the follwing steps to try it
out:

1. Open two terminals

2. Type in the 1st terminal:
	> cd server
	> ./hotchpotch.sh

	This will start the Hotchpotch server in the forground. To stop the server
	type "CTRL+g q".

3. In the 2nd terminal type:
	> cd client
	> ./boot.py
	> ./launchbox.py

The stores place their files under "server/priv/stores/". Initially all stores start
empty. When executing "boot.py" some necessary documents are created in the system
store. This has to be done only once after the system store was created.

There are some convenient options then starting the server:

	> hotchpotch.sh clear
	This will clear out all stores. Call boot.py before any other client then.

	> hotchpotch.sh save <name>
	This will save the state of all stores to a tar+gzip archive under
	"server/priv/snapshots/<name>.tgz".

	> hotchpotch.sh restore <name>
	Restore the state of all stores from the given checkpoint.
